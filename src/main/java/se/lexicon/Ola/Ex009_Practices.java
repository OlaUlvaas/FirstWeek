/**
 * Practices:
 * Create a String with your first name as content. Print out the String object to the console.
 * Create two Strings. One with your first name and the other with your last name.
 * Print out both Strings to the console with a ” ” separating them.
 * Create two variables with decimal values. Create a third decimal variable called result.
 * Assign the sum of the two first variables to result.
 *
 * Practices:
 * Create a class called Car. The class should contain the following information.
 * Car brand, registration number, max speed, owner name and one more attribute of your choice.
 * Instantiate an Object of the class and assign values to the object.
 * Make an integer called score and assign a value to it.
 * Create an if-statement that should print out”Hurray, You passed!” if the score is above or equals to 65.
 * If the score is Equal or between 55 and 64 it should print ”You are almost there.”.
 * If score is below 55 it should print ”Sorry, You did not pass.”
